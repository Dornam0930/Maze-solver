This is a guided project that I have completed that makes a maze
First it makes a grid of cells of a specified size
Then it makes those into a maze based off a specified seed, or random if none is supplied, by breaking down walls between cells
Lastly, it attempts to solve the maze with a depth first search, and tells you if it is or is not solvable
